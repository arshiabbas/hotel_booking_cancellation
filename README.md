The Hotel Booking and Cancellation Analysis project aimed to examine hotel booking trends and cancellation rates to improve business strategies and customer satisfaction. A total of 119,390 hotel bookings were analyzed, with 44,224 cancellations observed across city hotels and resort hotels. The project delved into understanding the reasons behind cancellations and identifying customer demographics, such as couples, singles, and families, to tailor marketing approaches. Additionally, the analysis highlighted booking patterns over time, revealing higher booking volumes in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2017. The project utilized Excel for data processing and visualization, culminating in an interactive dashboard for comprehensive insights.
